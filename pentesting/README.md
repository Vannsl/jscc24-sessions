# Pentesting

## Phases of a Pentest

1. Reconnaissance
2. Enumeration
3. Vulnerability Analysis
4. Exploitation
5. Cleanup

## Resources to start

- [Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page)
- Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual OSSTMM
- Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Testing Framework -
- [MITRE Att&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)

## Further Resources

- OWASP Application Security
- Web Application Hacker's Handbook Testing Checklist
- Information System Security Assessment Framework
- Secure Coding Challenges
- PortSwigger: amazing information about Web Security. There's a very challenging certification

## Note Taking

> When you're doing a pentest, document everything you're doing.

### Tools for Note Taking

- Obsidian
- Cherrytree
- Joplin (or so)
- Sublime
- ...many more

## Step by step:

- Host Enumeration
- Network Mapping
- Service Fingerprinting
- Vulnerability Identification
- Identification of Key Systems

## Demo

```bash
sudo nmap -sn -n -vv <Target-Range>
# -sn: do not scan ports
# -n: do not do DNS resolution
# -vv: tell me what you're doing
# <Target-Range>: Scan in this range
```

> When doing a pen test, it's better to now all cards on the table, and all credentials.

## Scouting

- [DNSDumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) (OSS), it gives you all sorts of information about DNS stuff
- [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), for internet-connected services

## More Tools

There's a tool called Netcat, which is useful for identification of services. But make sure which version you're using, the wrong one might be installed. It's often installed on Linux machines.
Then, there's Burp, which costs a bit of money, but looks and works very nice.
Burg is an HTTP proxy, that tracks traffic from a website to the Backend. It has a built in version of Chrome and can check certificate issues.
